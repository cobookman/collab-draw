# Collaborative Drawing

This simple stupid collaborative drawing webapp is provided to give insight on
the benefits of containers, and the various ways of deploying a container to
GCP.

If you look at the code, you'll notice it was written to allow for the container
to run on just about any environment, be it GCP, AWS, or your dev machine.
